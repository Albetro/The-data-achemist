Amazon Product Scraper (MVP)


This project aims to develop a web scraper tool (MVP) to extract product information from Amazon product pages. The initial focus is on gathering basic data points like:

    Product Name
    Product Rating
    Price
    Image URLs (list of URLs for all product images)
    Description

Scraped data can be saved in user-defined formats like CSV (Comma-Separated Values) or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for further analysis or use.

Project Goals:

    User-Friendly: Provide a straightforward interface (command-line or web-based) for users to interact with the scraper.
    Ethical Scraping: Prioritize responsible scraping practices by respecting robots.txt guidelines and implementing delays between requests to avoid overwhelming Amazon's servers.
    Flexibility: Offer users options to:
        Specify a product URL or a search term for scraping.
        Choose the desired output format (CSV or JSON).

Technologies (Potential):

    Programming Language: Python (recommended) due to its extensive ecosystem of libraries and beginner-friendliness. Other languages like Java or C# could also be considered.
    Web Scraping Libraries: Tools like Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML content and Requests for making HTTP requests to Amazon's website.
    Data Storage/Formatting Libraries: Libraries specific to handling CSV and JSON data formats for saving the scraped information.
    Command-Line Interface Library (Optional): Libraries like argparse can simplify user input and argument parsing within a command-line interface.
    Web Framework (Optional): Frameworks like Flask can be used to create a basic web interface for user interaction if desired.

Current Status:

This project is currently in the active planning and development phase. Key milestones achieved include:

    User Stories: Defined clear and detailed user stories outlining the functionalities of the MVP.
    Architecture: Documented the project's architecture, including data flow and component interaction for the MVP.
    Engineering Tasks: Created a comprehensive breakdown of engineering tasks required to implement the user stories.
    Challenges: Identified potential technical and non-technical challenges that might arise during development.
    Collaboration: Established strategies for leveraging collaboration during development, including knowledge sharing, feedback, and continuous improvement.
    Project Updates: Defined potential adjustments to the deliverables based on further considerations, aiming to enhance user experience and data quality.

Development Progress:

    Development has begun, focusing on core functionalities outlined in the engineering tasks. This might involve:
        Implementing core scraping logic to fetch product data from Amazon pages.
        Building functionalities to handle user input (URL or search term) and output format selection.
        Developing data storage and formatting mechanisms to save scraped data in the chosen format.
        Integrating ethical scraping practices by introducing delays and respecting robots.txt.

Next Steps:

    Continue development, prioritizing functionalities for the MVP.
    Implement unit tests to ensure code quality and expected behavior of the scraper.
    Conduct rigorous internal testing on various product pages and iterate based on the results.
    Refine project documentation as development progresses.
    Explore potential future enhancements based on user feedback and project needs.

Disclaimer:

This scraper is intended for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly. It's crucial to adhere to Amazon's terms of service and ethical scraping practices. Always respect robots.txt guidelines and avoid overwhelming Amazon's servers with excessive requests.
